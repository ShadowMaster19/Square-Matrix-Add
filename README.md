# Square-Matrix
Adding and Handling Square Matrix 

## SqMatrix: A Java Square Matrix Program

The `SqMatrix` class is a Java Program designed to handle square matrices with various operations. This project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming and algorithmic problem-solving.

### Key Features

- **Matrix Initialization**: Create square matrices of any size with the ability to initialize elements.
- **String Representation**: Convert the matrix to a string format for easy visualization.
- **Element Addition**: Add elements to specific positions within the matrix.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Perform scalar multiplication on the matrix, returning a new matrix with the results.
- **Matrix Addition**: Add two matrices of the same size, returning a new matrix with the summed elements.
- **Matrix Refresh**: Calculate the average of neighboring elements for each position, creating a smoothed matrix.
- **Determinant Calculation**: Compute the determinant of the matrix, supporting both 2x2 and larger matrices using cofactor expansion.

### Learning Outcomes

- Developed a deeper understanding of matrix operations and their implementation in Java.
- Enhanced skills in algorithm design and optimization.
